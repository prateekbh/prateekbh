Hello!
------
I work with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) on their web and javaScript infrastructure. We focus on shipping better quality code and enabling our engineers to ship better and robust features faster to our consumers. I am also pretty focused on the performance of our client code that we ship via our web products and react antive apps.
Previously I contributed to next.js and Preact
