Hello!
------
I work with [Google Chrome](https://github.com/GoogleChrome) on various developer tooling projects. Focus is on adding in better defaults for frameworks that brings better performance for every web app. Most of such efforts goes towards [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [Preact-CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli/tree/master/packages/cli).

Most of my github contributions is a side effect of the above. I also play CS:GO occasionaly. If you wanna discuss stuff around web or ask me anything use this [link](https://github.com/prateekbh/prateekbh/issues).
